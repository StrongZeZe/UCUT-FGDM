The code of " Modeling the Cognitive Black-Box: A Utility-Driven Framework for Fuzzy Group Decision Making via the Dyadic Uncertainty of Self-Confidence and Trust" "Script" is the root folder of the project. Among them, "manus_deal_allCode.py" is the core code of the algorithm, and other .py files are for drawing and data processing.
Note that "manus_deal_allCode.py" uses the Python API for Lindo, and the optimization model involves 30 global variables and nearly 100 constraint functions, so the commercial "extended" license is used for processing.
The Data file contains 10000 sets of simulation data. (1) utility_lindo_sovel.py file, which is a subfile for using lindo model to deal with complex models, integrating processing model functions and function functions that jump out directly after 5s memory error occurs (2) k_weight_produce.py file, function "def run_expert_simulation()" that integrates the ability to generate decision making k values and weight data under k values According to the requirements of five large cycles, generate the weight results corresponding to five different k values, and generate the weight data of 200 decision making in each large cycle -excel file name: "simulation_results(i).xlsx", analysis image name: "simulation_analysis(i).png", the output assessment_array(i).pkl and "k_value(i).pkl" can be directly used later.
(3) H-HFPRs_produce.py file, generate the consistent H-HFPRs matrix based on the weights generated by k_weight_produce.py, and store the data of the five cycles in "table_values_{i}.pkl" and "score_index" 200{i}.xlsx "file
(4) The trust_ets_produce.py file, based on the k_value(i).PKL result, generates fixed prior self-confidence and trust, as well as the confidence level of decision-making, which is used to simulate the situation where the acquaintance among decision making is relatively large. The data is stored in "trust_ets_{i}.pkl" and "trust_ets_{i}.xlsx" files.
(5) The trust_ets_produce_random.py file, based on the k_value(i).pkl result, generates fixed prior self-confidence and self-confidence confidence levels. Trust is randomly generated, and the confidence level of trust is randomly obtained from a more dispersed distribution to simulate the situation where decision making do not know each other. The data is stored in "trust_ets_random{i}.pkl" and "trust_ets_random{i}.xlsx" files.
(6) trust_ets_produce_True.py file, based on the result of k_value(i).pkl, randomly extract trust and trust confidence from trust_ets_{i}.xlsx and trust_ets_random{i}.xlsx, Simulate the situations of random acquaintance and random acquaintance among decision making, and store the data in the files "trust_ets_random{i}.pkl" and "trust_ets_random{i}.xlsx".
(7) The trust_ets_none_confi_produce.py file is used to generate data without considering self-confidence and to test how the results would change if the sensitivity of each decision making were not taken into account. Just on the basis of ④, set all the confidence and confidence levels to 0.9, and the generated files will be in the "trust_ets_none_confi_{i}.pkl" and "trust_ets_none_confi_{i}.xlsx" files.
The Run_simulation_datas.py file, which is used to process simulation data in batches, contains a total of four experiments characterized by the flag_test variable, flag_test={1,2,3} :
Experiment 1: Relying on the decision making's ability, fix the prior self-confidence and trust, as well as the confidence level of decision-making. Simulate mutual understanding among decision making.
Experiment 2: Assuming that decision making are not acquainted with each other, fixed prior self-confidence and self-confidence confidence levels are set, but trust is randomly selected. The confidence levels are linked to prior self-confidence but obtained through a more dispersed distribution. The simulated decision making do not know each other.
Experiment 3: Randomly select the confidence levels of trust and trust from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 to simulate the situations of random acquaintance and random acquaintance among decision making.
Experiment 4: Based on the result data from Experiment 1, both self-confidence and confidence level were adjusted to 0.9. The simulation does not take into account self-confidence regulation to make the sensitivity among decision making the same (similar to traditional methods).
Considering the demodulation and memory impact of lindoAPI, it is necessary to manually set flag_test=? To determine which experiment it was. The saved results are stored in the test1, test2, test3 folders of the simulation_data folder, respectively.
break_ij represents the simulation data set that did not throw the correct answer the first time because of memory usage;
group_weight_name = os.path.join(eval("position"+str(flag_test)),f"group_weight_{flag_test}.pkl") # Store the set of weights for the final group consensus
group_CI_name = os.path.join(eval("position"+str(flag_test)),f"group_CI_{flag_test}.pkl") # Store the final set of group decision consensus level results
group_utility_name = os.path.join(eval("position"+str(flag_test)),f"group_utility_loss_{flag_test}.pkl") # Store the final set of utility reduction levels
GCD_final_name = os.path.join(eval("position"+str(flag_test)),f"GCD_final_name_{flag_test}.pkl") # Store the final group consensus set
GROUP_H_name = os.path.join(eval("position"+str(flag_test)),f"GROUP_H_name_{flag_test}.pkl") # Store the set of final group consensus matrices
DMs_H_name = os.path.join(eval("position"+str(flag_test)),f"DMs_H_{flag_test}.pkl") # stores the final decision matrix of each decision making
C_T_FINAL_name = os.path.join(eval("position"+str(flag_test))),f"C_T_FINAL_{flag_test}.pkl") # stores the self-confidence and trust among the final decision making
break_ij_record_name = os.path.join(eval("position" + str(flag_test)),f"break_ij_{flag_test}.pkl") # stores the self-confidence and trust among the final decision making
feedback_Num_{i} represents the number of feedbacks and is used to calculate the average time of the algorithm.
The complete_data.py file is used to make up for the data that did not run properly in Run_simulation_datas.py. We need to run all three experiments in Run_simulation_datas.py.
run_sensitive.datas.py is a sensitivity analysis file, used to run the shape parameter ∈(0,10) (stored in the sensibility1 folder), (2) The reaching time of different GCD thresholds (stored in sensibility2_blackBox and sensibility2_whiteBox folders), where sensibility2_blackBox stores the number of feedback needed for the research model to reach the threshold of 0.99; The sensibility2_whiteBox file stores the number of feedbacks needed to reach a threshold of 0.99 for the model without considering the unknown information (i.e., the external reward).
(11) compare_others_research_Bayes.py is comparative analysis "A Bayesian Framework For Modelling The Trust Relationships To Group Decision "Making Problems" research code, its main functions are: ① transform the input of this study into the input of this study; ② Based on the method of the paper, for two experimental backgrounds, 500 times of simulation data are extracted for each experimental background, and the results (program weight, feedback times, group consensus degree) are not selected True. The reason is that this literature uses the trust transfer theory, which deals with unknown trust.
(12) compare_others_research_person.py is a comparative analysis "Personalized trust incentive mechanisms with personality characteristics for minimum cost consensus in group decision making "research code, its main functions are ① to transform the input of this research into the input of this research ② based on the method of the paper, for three kinds of experimental background, the simulation data of each experimental background are drawn 500 times, Out of the results (scheme weight, feedback times, group consensus degree), True was not selected, because the trust transfer theory was used in this literature to deal with unknown trust.
(13)compare_others_research_consensus.py is a comparative analysis of "Consensus adjustment mechanism in view of coalition structure-based cooperative game for group decision making with distribution linguistic preference relations" Stored in the "compare_consensus" file, the paper does not consider trust issues.
